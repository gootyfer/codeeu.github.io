title: Ode To Code Video Contest
---

<p>When Europe Code Week 2015 was announced in Urbino, two kids heard the tune that was playing from the smartphone of a girl nearby and decided that the music was much better than the presenter&rsquo;s voice. They went by the mixer, switched to the music, and started to code a dance inspired by the rhythm. The results were surprising&hellip;</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/BO9x6XImDfQ">A similar phenomenon</a> was observed in Amsterdam in August, when Europe Code Week and Africa Code Week were jointly presented at the <a href="http://www.scratch2015ams.org">Scratch Conference 2015.</a></p>

<p>The tune that had this effect has been recognized to be the &ldquo;Ode to code&rdquo; and it is expected to have the same effect on people, animals, and robots wherever it is heard. To collect evidence of this phenomenon CodeWeek has launched a video contest inviting any witness to record a short video showing the effects that the music has everywhere around the world. Observed effects include: unintentional robot dancing, open air programming, flash mobs, bubbles, &hellip;</p>
